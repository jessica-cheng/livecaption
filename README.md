## Overview
We're building an Android app that will "record" someone's speech and turn it into text.

## Basic Usage
Click the "Start Recording" button, and speech directed at the phone will be transcribed in real time.
Click the "Stop Recording" button to stop.

Below, click the text box to input a message you want to "say".
(In the works) Press the "Play" button to have the app "say" what you typed in.
